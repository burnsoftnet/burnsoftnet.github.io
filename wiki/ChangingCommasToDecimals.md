Language settings on your computer are putting in the comma when a decimal is needed.

1.) Click on Control Panel 2.) Click on Clock, language, & region 3.) click on region & language 4.) Then click on the "Formats" tab and check your language setting. 5.) Select "Additional Settings" at the bottom of the dialogue box, you should be able to choose your decimal separator as "," or "."

Remember what you did, just in case you need to go back and un-do it.
